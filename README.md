# Supervised-ML
Supervised learning is the types of machine learning in which machines are trained using well "labelled" training data, and on basis of that data, machines predict the output. The labelled data means some input data is already tagged with the correct output.

I have created a prediction model using supervised machine learning algorithm which is used to predict the new data.
I have mention all the steps on that:

Step 1 :- Importing all the required libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, etc.  
Step 2 :- Fetch the data using remote link.  
Step 3 :- Plot the distribution graph.  
Step 4 :- Data preprocessing.  
Step 5 :- Model training.  
Step 6 :- Plotting the line of regression.  
Step 7 :- Making predictions.  
Step 8 :- Comparing actual result to the Predicted Model result.  
Step 9 :- Evaluating the model.
